<h2>III Measurement of the Speed of Communications – Methods and Sources</h2>
<p class="noindent"><em>Introduction to the different methods of measuring the speed and frequency of communications – Consecutive information circles as tools in measuring the speed of business information transmission</em></p>
<p class="h3"><strong>Introduction to the different methods of measuring the speed and frequency of communications</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">Historians often find it difficult to receive an accurate answer to the question of the duration of information transmission. Problems vary depending on the mail route (sea, overland, or mixed), the time period (war times, seasonal variations, general level of technological development) and the source material in question (correspondence, newspapers, administrative documents).</p>
<p class="indent">The nature of sources available, as well as their quality and quantity, gives firm limits to what can be attained by examining the information flows. If the interest is in personal contacts, for example the speed of a particular merchant’s business information transmission, the main sources are the received letters in the company’s correspondence. Yet they can be complemented with maritime intelligence from contemporary newspapers or postal historical studies. Sailing data from newspapers, customs bills etc. are the main sources if the interest is in the general conditions of information transmission. Letters with postal markings and handstamps give more and better information on the transmission than privately sent or very early letters with only the writer’s and recipient’s handwritten markings.</p>
<p class="indent">Generally speaking, there are three main aspects to consider when choosing the method for measuring the speed of information transmission:</p>
<ul class="bul">
<li>measurement of the duration of information transmission from the sender to the recipient of the message</li>
<li>measurement of the duration of transport between two places</li>
<li>measurement of the frequency of transport between two places</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">These aspects have often been used for the measurement of the speed of information transmission without clearly distinguishing the difference between what has been measured and what is talked about.</p>
<p class="indent">The information transmission from the writer to the recipient obviously includes the second aspect, the duration of transport between the two places in question, and is very much dependent on the third one, the frequency of the transport available.</p>
<p class="indent">The first aspect deals mainly with correspondence between two individuals and leads to the research of personal communications, while the two other aspects generally deal with public sources – like newspapers, customer bills, post office records and collected sailing data in postal historical studies – and focuses on public communications. The two latter aspects <em>explain</em> the duration of personal communications, while the personal correspondence with its postal markings and handstamps can <em>verify</em> the data and statistics given by public sources. Therefore, the use of different aspects together can portray an issue better than the use of one aspect only.</p>
<p class="indent">The most common method in measuring the speed of information transmission in history studies has been the simple calculation of days between writing and receiving letters. This method can only give limited results, however.</p>
<p class="indent">Firstly, only received letters are useful in the research, as the copies of letters sent do not include information about the arrival date in the other end. Copy books of sent letters can sometimes complete the picture shedding light on the information circulation or the frequency of communications. By using only the writing and arrival dates of the letters for measuring the speed of information transmission, several important aspects remain unknown.</p>
<p class="indent">The transmission of an overseas letter can be described as a process, which is sliced into several independent parts: how long it took for the writer to send the letter after writing it, how long it took for the local system (coffee house, forwarding agent, post office) to forward it to an ocean going vessel (if overseas mail), how long it took before the ship was ready to leave from the port, how long the sea journey was, and how efficiently the letter was forwarded and finally delivered at the other end. Naturally, the duration of the whole process also depended on the frequency of the mail transport available.</p>
<p class="indent">To understand how the process worked and thus be able to distinguish the fixed elements of information transmission from occasional delays, it is useful to learn to understand the postal historical elements of the material examined.</p>
<p class="indent">Postal handstamps and other markings on the letters made by post offices are of great help when examining the factual speed of information transmission. They give accurate dates of departures and arrivals of the letters, as well as the transit places. The handstamps were needed to inform the receiving post office, as well as the final recipient who had to pay for the transport, by which route the letter had been carried. The inland postage rates depended on the length of the route by which the letter was carried, while the ship letters had their own instructions. For fiscal purposes, it was important that the system worked promptly, and much effort was put into correcting mistakes instantly.</p>
<p class="indent">Handwritten instructions on the covers are also very useful for a historian, regarding the means of communications (‘per Packet’, ‘per English Steamer’, ‘per Neptune’, ‘p. Capt. Read’) or the route (‘via Panama’, ‘via Marseilles’). Also these markings are usually reliable, as there were strict regulations about the rates depending on different mail routes, mail contracts, etc. The changes <em>en route</em> were most often corrected on the cover, or they can be noticed from differing postal handstamps.</p>
<p class="indent">By carefully reading the postal markings of the covers and examining the postal history, it is usually possible to discover further information regarding the letter’s trip from the writer to the recipient instead of just calculating the days between writing and receiving it.</p>
<p class="indent">One of the rare academic studies crossing the border of philatelic postal history has been conducted by John J. McCusker, who examined the origins of one single letter in his essay <em>New York City and the Bristol Packet</em>.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b44" id="a44">44</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The letter, found by McCusker himself as a boy, appeared to be an important document in the history of the first packet service between Bristol and New York in 1710<em>–</em>13. As the author puts it, ‘administrative, philatelic, archival and genealogical evidence united to support the validity of the conclusion’ that the letter was really sent from New York early in May 1711 by one of the packets. ‘The letter traveled on precisely the business and precisely the route that the organizers of the packet service had intended. It linked English and colonial merchants and secured their communications during a time of war. London merchants, like Joseph Levy [the recipient of the letter], had been the ones who had pressed for the packet. For Levy and Simson, and many more like them, the mails meant the continuation of their business but government, too, realized the need, and reaped the advantages of secure lines of communications with the Continental Colonies.’<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b45" id="a45">45</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Complementary methods obviously add value to the research. In addition to the data collected from personal correspondence, and especially if the main interest of the study is in public communications, general news flows or the efficiency of mail systems, maritime intelligence from contemporary newspapers or relevant postal historical studies are of great help. As already mentioned in the Introduction, most British and French mail steamship routes as of 1838 are well covered by postal historians at least to 1875, the year when the Universal Postal Union, or UPU, was established and the international postal rates were uniformed. Earlier mail sailings are also often well documented in postal historical studies, or the data can be found from contemporary newspapers.</p>
<p class="indent">An example from the writer’s postal historical collection may clarify the usefulness of combining the classic method of calculating the difference between the dates of writing a letter and receiving it, the postal markings on the letter and the sailing data published in the contemporary newspapers or postal historical studies:</p>
<p class="indent">In the late 18th century, there was a monthly British Post Office sailing packet service between Falmouth, England, and New York. A letter from Richmond, Virginia, with the note ‘p. Packet’, was handstamped in the Richmond Post Office on 2 September, 1796 and on arrival in London 18 weeks later, 5 January, 1797.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b46" id="a46">46</a></sup> (See Fig. 1) As the letter was obviously written in Richmond (it is not dated) and it was addressed to London, there should not have been any delays at either end of the journey. But how could it take 125 days to bring the letter from South Carolina to England?</p>
<p class="indent">According to <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, two mail packets had arrived at Falmouth from New York on the same day, 2 January, 1797. This matched perfectly with the arrival handstamp of London on 5 January. One of the packets was the <em>Countess of Lei[ce]ster</em>, which had sailed ‘in 7 weeks’, and the other was the <em>Princess of Wales</em>, ‘in 5 weeks’.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b47" id="a47">47</a></sup> As the mails should have arrived once a month, at least one of the ships was at least two weeks late. There had been problems in the westbound packet service already, as the writer starts his letter by complaining that ‘your last of 2d May only reachd me last week owing to the delay of the Packet’. Due to the war time (French war 1793<em>–</em>1802), dozens of mail packets were captured, including one in June which probably should have carried the letter if available.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b48" id="a48">48</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The unlucky combination of a late incoming packet and the need for waiting at port, primitive inland connections between Richmond and New York – only one post rider was in service, as the mail coaches would start on the Virginia route just a few years later<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b49" id="a49">49</a></sup> – and the five to seven weeks sailing from New York to England caused an accumulated delay to the information transmission. However, the facts known verify that the sea transport had taken only 30<em>–</em>40 per cent of the whole transmission time. Studying only the writer’s and recipient’s markings on the letter would have given an incorrect picture of the overseas communications, and studying only the sailing data would have given a mistaken picture of the whole process of information transmission.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the historian’s interest is not only in the duration of the information transmission but in learning more about the process of how the mail was carried. The letter itself may give little to start with but even those markings may open a path to an exciting story about how information was transmitted during that period.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a letter (see Fig. 2) to ‘Messrs Magowe &amp; Son, Boston’ was written in Calcutta on 6 December, 1851, and handstamped on the reverse by the Calcutta General Post Office on the 8th. Additionally, there are the British handstamps of London and Boston on 15 January, 1852; ‘INDIA’ by red letters; a few rate markings; and a handwritten remark ‘America’. The recipient has finally marked the arrival date on the reverse, February 9th. All the needed information exists to find out the duration of information transmission: 65 days from the writer to the recipient. We even learn that the letter was handled by the Calcutta G.P.O. only two days after the writing, so there was not much delay. The British markings show that the letter has been carried via England.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b50" id="a50">50</a></sup></p>
<div class="keep">

<p class="caption">FIG. 1. <em>War time communications was slow and unpredictable. The letter, sent on 2.9.1796 from Richmond, Virginia, was delayed for more than two months in the United States until it was finally carried from New York to England by one of the Falmouth packets. The letter arrived in London on 5.1.1797, in 125 days. (See the text.)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent1">But how did the letter arrive in Britain and further to the United States? By combining the facts available on the cover and what can be achieved from existing postal historical studies, we learn a lot more about the information transmission process. After being written in Calcutta on December 6th and handstamped by the Post Office on the 8th, the letter was taken by the Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company’s, or the P&amp;O’s, branch steamer to Galle, Ceylon, and from there on the 16th by a larger P&amp;O vessel, the <em>Oriental</em>, via Aden to Suez, arriving there on 1 January, 1852. From Suez the letter was taken overland across the desert by donkey, dromedary and riverboat services to Alexandria, Egypt, from where the letter continued on 5 January by a third P&amp;O vessel, the <em>Ripon</em>, to Malta. It arrived on the 9th and proceeded on the same day by the British Admiralty steam packet <em>Banshee</em>, Lieutenant Hosken as the Captain, to Marseilles, arriving on the 11th.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b51" id="a51">51</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The mails were taken by railway to Calais, across the Channel by a branch steamer, and again by train to London, from where the letter was forwarded to Boston on 15 January. However, the letter was meant to be delivered to Boston in the United States, not in Britain. The word ‘America’ was added to the address, and the letter was sent across the Atlantic by the Cunard Line mail steamer <em>Niagara</em>, which departed from Liverpool on 17 January and arrived in New York on 7 February, or by the same company’s <em>Europa,</em> which departed on 24 January and arrived in Boston on 8 February.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b52" id="a52">52</a></sup> In both cases the letter would have been dispatched in Boston on the 9th, as it happened. The trip by the <em>Niagara</em> took 21 days but that of the <em>Europa</em> only 15 days. The rough winter winds in the Atlantic were sometimes unpredictable, and the <em>Niagara’s</em> trip had been lengthened so much that the ship had to put into Halifax for coal on 4 February.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b53" id="a53">53</a></sup></p>
<div class="keep">
<p class="image"><img src="../images/002.jpg" alt="image"/></p>
<p class="caption">FIG. 2. <em>The letter sent on 6.2.1851 from Calcutta, India, was carried by P&amp;O, Admiralty and Cunard Line mail steamers, as well as railways, camels and donkeys, via Galle, Suez, Alexandria, Malta, Marseilles, London and Liverpool, before being received in Boston, United States, on 9.2.1852, in 65 days. (See the text.)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent1">By slicing into pieces the letter’s trip from Calcutta to Boston according to the means of transmission during the voyage, we discovered a great deal of information not available in the original letter. Instead of just finding out the duration of the information transmission, we learnt that the letter was carried by six different mail steamers and several trains, as well as donkey, dromedary and river boat. We could notice that the international mail system worked smoothly already in the mid-19th century, especially when the letters were carried by British services all the way. The waiting times were short, but there could be some variation in the duration of longer sea journeys as in the Atlantic crossing.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition to the use of personal correspondence, the speed of arriving news has generally been measured from the time lag of foreign news published in the newspapers. Päiviö Tommila calculated in his pioneering article in 1960, how long it took for the news of <em>Finlands Allmänna Tidning,</em> an official newspaper, to arrive in Finland from different countries in 1830.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b54" id="a54">54</a></sup> Ian K. Steele used the same method to calculate the age of London-based news in some American newspapers in 1705<em>–</em>1740, and Allan R. Pred for calculating the spread of news between the major American cities in 1790<em>–</em>1840.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b55" id="a55">55</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The method of comparing known facts of historical events with the dates on which the news was published in the newspapers in other countries leave several questions open. By which means was the news carried, how long was the waiting time before the transport, what was the duration of the transport, how long did it take before the next issue of the newspaper was published, and finally, how long did it take before the newspaper was delivered to the readers, probably again far from the place where the paper was printed.</p>
<p class="indent">To measure the duration of maritime news transmission, Yrjö Kaukiainen calculated the difference between the dates on which the sailing lists from distant ports were sent and on which they were published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em> in London. This method gives comparable knowledge from different routes and different time periods, and is very useful for measuring the speed of one-way information transmission.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b56" id="a56">56</a></sup> However, it does not tell the whole truth about the duration of information transmission from the recipient’s point of view. As the news in the earlier times was carried by occasional merchantmen, the readers in Britain often had to wait one or two extra months to learn e.g. of a particular ship’s arrival, simply because there were no vessels arriving from that port to bring the news.</p>
<p class="indent">For example, a sailing list from Hong Kong published in <em>Lloyd’s List</em> on 25 October, 1845, included arrivals and departures from that port between 20 June and 26 August. Thus, the age of the earliest news was 127 days while the latest news was only 60 days old when published in the same day’s newspaper.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b57" id="a57">57</a></sup> The frequency of mail transmission definitely played an important role in the information flows. When interpreting the figures, it is important to keep in mind the difference between the measurement of duration of the mail transportation itself (which was chiefly examined by Kaukiainen) and the measurement of the duration of spreading the news contents.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, when using Allan Pred’s figures of the ‘relative level of interregional shipping interaction’ between the coast ports of the United States, it should be remembered that the ‘weighted arrivals’ are not the same as the factual sailings.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b58" id="a58">58</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Ian K. Steele calculated the duration of early North Atlantic sailings using British port records of customs entrances and clearances, finding important information on the frequency and duration of sailings during the period 1675<em>–</em>1740. Yet, as Steele noted, by this method the duration of sea journeys is calculated only from customs to customs.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b59" id="a59">59</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In real life, the final departure dates could vary several days from the customs records. It often took days after the clearance before the ship really departed, due to bad weather or other delays. The ship could even put back having already sailed due to damage caused by storm or other unexpected events.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b60" id="a60">60</a></sup> Thus, the figures do not reflect the duration of the sea voyage only, but may include other elements.</p>
<p class="indent">A comparison between the customs records and the final sailing data from the port of Liverpool in 1825 give a good example of the difference. The American sailing packets, although scheduled for regular line service, did not always depart on the given date, even if they had cleared in good time to be able to do that. The clearance usually took place on the scheduled departure date or the day before, but in half of the cases in 1825 the ship was delayed, the average delay being four days and the variation from one to 12 days.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b61" id="a61">61</a></sup> When measuring the duration of sailings, there can thus be a major difference in the results depending on which method has been chosen.</p>
<p class="indent">Naturally, the newspaper dates may have included more errors, while the customs bills were administrative records with most obviously correct data. Yet the maritime intelligence of <em>Lloyd’s List</em> was at least ‘semi-official’, being collected by Lloyd’s agents and correspondents for the use of underwriters. A general rule in using newspaper data is that the longer the distance between the event (e.g. ship arrival) and the place of publishing it, the more potential there is for errors. In those cases where postal historical studies have been based on e.g. Caribbean newspapers, some additional caution is needed when considering the precision of the dates given.</p>
<p class="indent">Carl C. Cutler used a combination of custom house records, log books and maritime intelligence of contemporary newspapers to collect sailing lists of the American tea clipper voyages in the 1850s.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b62" id="a62">62</a></sup> Colin Tabeart based his study of the Admiralty Packets in the Mediterranean on data collected from the ships’ logs and maritime intelligence from the newspapers, combining these with factual postal information from the letters carried on the route.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b63" id="a63">63</a></sup> The latter one is an especially excellent combination, but seldom available.</p>
<p class="indent">Some historians give figures of exactly how many days, hours and minutes a transatlantic crossing took by a specific vessel.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b64" id="a64">64</a></sup> These figures are usually based on newspaper reports or the ships’ log books, sources which are not available in all cases.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b65" id="a65">65</a></sup> To be consistent, all voyages in this study have been calculated by using the same sources: sailing lists of mail-carrying ships, published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em> or relevant postal historical studies.<em><sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b66" id="a66">66</a></sup></em></p>
<p class="indent">These sources can only afford sailing dates, not hours or minutes. There is naturally a difference, if the ship departs early in the morning and arrives at the destination port a few days later in the evening, or if she departs in the evening and arrives in the early morning. Even if the method of calculating the duration of journeys only by dates cannot be really accurate in a particular case, it gives a good overview of the situation. The ‘grey margin’ remains the same throughout the period, and the system treats all companies evenly. A comparison of sailing data published by Hubbard &amp; Winter in <em>North Atlantic Mail Sailings 1840–75</em> and the Cunard Line records for the Admiralty 1840<em>–</em>1846,<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b67" id="a67">67</a></sup> gives the following results:</p>
<p class="indent">The Cunard Line’s ships sailed from Liverpool on regular dates but the departing hour varied greatly. There may have been several reasons for this, one of which was the exceptionally strong tide at the River Mersey. Besides that, especially during the latter part of the period, departures often took place in the afternoon or even in the evening, perhaps waiting for the latest business correspondence. At the other end of the journey, arrivals often occurred in the early morning, but could also take place at any other time of the day.</p>
<p class="indent">Comparison between the duration of passages, calculated from the sailing lists of Hubbard &amp; Winter and the Cunard statistics, show that even if there were several hours’ differences in the duration of sailings on particular voyages, the differences balanced each other rather well in the long run. Between 4 July 1840 and 5 May 1846, the difference between the sailing lists of Hubbard &amp; Winter and the company records concerning 112 westbound sailings was only three hours on average. The duration of trips calculated using the dates only was longer each year than if the duration was calculated by using the exact sailing hours. However, in specific cases the difference could be positive as well as negative.</p>
<p class="indent">What methods should be used to estimate the mass of information transmitted? For example, the statistics of income from postage rates to the post offices have sometimes been used to figure out the growth of the number of letters sent during a time period.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b68" id="a68">68</a></sup> Yet the rates of single letters may have changed markedly during the period, the relation between cheaper short-distance and much more expensive long-distance mail may have changed – and these figures could not be compared with other cities of different geographic location even in the same year. Finally, the newspapers were normally not included in the postage rate figures.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b69" id="a69">69</a></sup> Therefore, these figures probably describe best the fiscal importance of the postal services. Numbers of letters sent during a specific period can naturally be compared with numbers of letters sent during another period of the same length.</p>
<p class="indent">As has been noted, there is no single method which would answer all questions regarding information transmission. Even though all methods can be used to measure something, it should be kept in mind that there is a great difference in what can be achieved by using the alternative methods. Table 4 may be of help in the consideration.</p>
<p class="h3"><strong>Consecutive information circles as tools in measuring the speed of business information transmission</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">The need for fast information transmission often varied between the different parties in mercantile societies. Newspapers wanted to get the freshest news as quickly as possible, and for them rapid one-way information flow was critical. But for traders – depending on the nature of their business – it was often at least equally important that the system enabled them to answer the business letters rapidly, and again to receive fast answers to their letters.</p>
<p class="indent">A practical tool which has not previously been used for measuring the speed of business information transmission in published studies is to calculate the number of consecutive information circles enabled by a particular service within a calendar year. This tool enables us to examine in a commensurable way the efficiency and development of the information circulation during different time periods and on different routes.</p>
<p class="indent">One information circle is equal to the time between sending a letter and getting an answer to it. While a round trip of a mail-carrying ship means the period from the ship departure from the home port to the arrival back home, an information circle could be shorter, if there were other mail-carrying vessels departing earlier from the other end, and they were able to carry the answer. Thus, the length of an information circle depended not only on the duration of two one-way trips but also on the frequency of the sailings.</p>
<p class="indent">The duration of the sailings can be calculated from the sailing data published in different postal historical studies, or if such a study is not obtainable for a specific route or time period, from the maritime intelligence published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em> or other contemporary newspapers. By combining information on the arrivals and departures of mail-carrying ships, it is easy to find out how the system worked at both ends of the trip. A combination of these facts gives us the length of one information circle and enables the calculation of numbers of consecutive information circles per year.</p>

<p class="image1"><img src="../images/003.jpg" alt="image" class="h_img"/></p>
</div>
<p class="indent1">How this system worked in reality, and whether the trade partners really used it in an optimal way, can be examined from the correspondence of the various merchant houses. The handstamps and other postal markings of the letters also give us a clear idea of which postal service has been used in cases where there were several possibilities, for example the alternating British and French government mail services for South America in the 1860s.</p>
<p class="indent">It should be noticed that this tool measures the best possible information circulation (the maximum number of consecutive information circles) between two places within a time period, for example one year. There may have been many other possibilities to send mail in one direction, but this method gives us an idea about how the two-way communications worked in practice. It was surprisingly often a very different story.</p>
