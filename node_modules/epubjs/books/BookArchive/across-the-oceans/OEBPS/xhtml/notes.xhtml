McCloskey (ed.), <em>Essays on a Mature Economy: Britain after 1840</em> (London, 1971), 215–237. Harley’s study does not cover the mail and passenger steamship services, which competed in a very different market. In accordance with Harley’s paper, it has also been argued that the huge increase in cargo carrying capacity was the end result of a century of evolution, starting from the 1860s and ending in the 1960s. The process was basically a matter of successive relatively small increments in size and speed, in carrying capacity and fuel efficiency. The two major ‘revolutions’ in technology were the interaction of metal construction and steam propulsion to produce ships capable of operating economically over long distances on regular schedules, and the introduction of containerization. See Malcolm Cooper, ‘From <em>Agamemnon</em> to <em>Priam</em>: British liner shipping in the China Seas, 1865–1965’ in Richard Harding, Adrian Jarvis &amp; Alston Kennerley, <em>British Ships in China Seas: 1700 to the Present Day</em> (Liverpool, 2004), 225.</p>

The average in Europe was 2.8. but for example in Finland and Norway less than 2.0. See Yrjö Kaukiainen, ‘Finnish sailors, 1750–1870’ in Lars U.

<p class="note2"><a href="ch002.xhtml#a13" id="b13">13</a> Postal historical research focuses on the postal markings and handstamps of the letters instead of their contents. In a few cases, some attention has also been paid to the contents to shed more light on the circumstances in which the information was transmitted. As will be explained in Chapter II, this study is not about mercantile networks but about how the systems of business information transmission developed during the chosen period.</p>

<p class="note2"><a href="ch002.xhtml#a15" id="b15">15</a> There are several distinguished postal historical studies of the postage rates of the period. See George E.

<p class="note2"><a href="ch002.xhtml#a18" id="b18">18</a> Liverpool, being the European port of three American sailing packet lines with weekly transatlantic service, as well as of the most important transatlantic mail steamship companies (Cunard Line, Collins Line, Inman Line, White Star Line, etc.), was the most important information hub in the North Atlantic communications ca. 1820–1870 and the second trade port of England after London only, when it comes to business with e.g. the West Indies, South America or East India. The merchant correspondences have been chosen here mainly from the philatelic point of view: there had to be postal markings on the covers received. For example, the letter copy books of senders (which normally form a great part of the correspondence examined in network studies) are not at all useful from this point of view. In earlier times, letters were not put into covers but just folded and sealed. In these cases, the postal markings have been saved on the backside of the received documents. Later, only the contents were often saved while the merchant houses threw away the unnecessary covers or they have later been sold to philatelic markets by the descendants of the merchant families, or other persons involved in the business. Much material has been destroyed in wars, fires, mergers, etc. All this limits the possibilities to find relevant merchant correspondence especially for postal historical studies. In the case of the East India Company, their letters were carried in bundles with no Post Office markings. However, the clerks of the India House have carefully documented the date of arrival of each letter as well as by which ship the letter has arrived. By using this information, it is possible to find out from the sailing data published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, how long time the sea journey took in each case from the entire duration of the information transmission. All the letters of these merchant correspondences have been compared with the existing sailing data from other sources to ascertain how the existing services were used in practice.</p>

While bills of exchange, based on sterling dominated international trade, and were especially popular in Anglo-American trade, the Americans often operated with Russia on credit accounts arranged by the ‘American houses’ in London, and ‘as London was the centre of world trade an importer of any kind of product could manage his payments using bills drawn on his London banker’. Ahonen also describes how direct barter trade was used in the Havana sugar trade, as well as the use of Spanish silver dollars, where the right moment to buy and use specie was always a topical question for shippers interested in Cuba.

The precision of the record keeping varies but the sailing and arrival times are normally given in an accurate form. A considerable problem is, however, that the time difference between Europe and North America has been calculated in different ways on the voyages, or totally ignored, in each direction. The use of the Passage Books for the Cunard voyages would mislead the study, as there are no similar sources available from all shipping companies included. <em>Cunard Passage Books 1</em>–<em>4</em> cover the years 1848–1881.

<p class="note2"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a96" id="b96">96</a> Falmouth is located on the southwest coast of England, some 270 miles from London. The ‘Great Post Road’ from Cornwall to London was not much more than an old ridgeway keeping to the drier high ground whenever possible. Despite the mostly poor condition of the road, ‘strategic staging’ had reduced the duration of mail transport between Falmouth and London to three or four days by the mid-18th century, and by 1798 to 2.5 days, which remained the norm for several decades. See Pawlyn, 9–16. Before the railways were built, about two more days had to be added for the mail service to places like Liverpool in northwest England.</p>

Britain was the major trading partner of both the United States and Russia over the whole period discussed. Its central role in Atlantic trade can be illustrated by the fact that around 1830 it produced about 45% of European pig iron and consumed 66% of its cotton wool.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a132" id="b132">132</a> This was no wonder, as the sailing lists of Liverpool port were sent to Lloyd’s in London by the Liverpool underwriters’ agents who were soon deeply involved in the American sailing packet business. The Liverpool underwriters had started an agency system of their own in 1815, but whenever possible they appointed as their agents men who were already acting as Lloyd’s agents.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a133" id="b133">133</a> The maritime intelligence regarding arrivals and departures 15–27.7.1818 at the port of New York was sent to England by the merchantman <em>Carolina Ann</em>. The ship departed from New York on 29 July, 1818, and arrived in Liverpool 30 days later, on 28 August. The sailing lists were published in <em>Lloyd’s List</em> 1.9.1818. – The maritime intelligence regarding the period 29.7–3.8.1818 was sent by the merchantman <em>Fair Cambrian</em>, which departed from New York on 7.8.1818 and arrived in Liverpool 28 days later, on 4 September. The sailing lists were published in <em>Lloyd’s List</em> 8.9.1818.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a134" id="b134">134</a> The inland mail from Liverpool to London by daily mail coach before the opening of the railway took about 24 hours in the mid-1820s (Wright &amp; Fayle, 340).or 30 hours ‘by the new stage coach’ which ‘carries but four insides, and only one night on the road’ (‘Coaches’ in <em>Post Office</em>, Liverpool Street Directories, 1818, Appendix, 85). As <em>Lloyd’s List</em> was published only twice a week before 1837, there were at least two obvious causes of delay between the ship arrival and the publishing of the intelligence.</p>

Hill’s calculations about the benefits of reducing the high inland postage rates to a uniform one penny rate caused a furious debate in public and in the Parliament. The uniform inland rate was introduced in 1840, together with the first prepaid postage stamp in the world, the Penny Black, as well as the prepaid stationery covers, known as Mulready covers according to their designer. These inventions supported the decision to adopt the one penny postage, as the stamps and stationery covers could be bought in quantities before use, and prepaid letters were easier and quicker to handle in the Post Office.

This would have meant an average profit of over £1,200 per voyage, compared with £1,350 of the ill-fated <em>President.</em> Bonsor notes that the figures most probably did not take into account interest charges, depreciation, insurance or management expenses, which turned the profit into a substantial loss and forced the company into liquidation. Bonsor (1975), vol. 1, 58.

Yet the Cunard ships were seldom obliged to make extra calls for coaling.

CP, SJ) The <em>Great Western</em> sailed from New York on 31.7., being another uncertain option for a New York business partner to answer the English mail. If the letters had been late for these ships, they would have been carried by the <em>Cambria</em> on 16.8. and arrived in Liverpool on 28.8. The rest of the circle would have been changed as follows: <em>Britannia,</em> CL, 4.9. from Liverpool, arrived in Boston 19.9., departure by the same ship 1.10. (the <em>Great Western</em> sailed from New York 18.9.), arriving in Liverpool 14.10. Departure from Liverpool by the <em>Caledonia</em>, CL, 19.10. and arrival in Boston 3.11., departure by the <em>Great Western</em> from New York 6.11. and arrival in Liverpool 21.11. – two days after the Cunard steamer <em>Cambria</em> had departed. The letter would have then been carried by the <em>Acadia</em>, CL, which sailed from Liverpool on 4.12. and arrived in Boston on 19.12. She departed on 1.1. and arrived in Liverpool on 15.1.1846. Thus there was very little help from the other steamships in traffic as there was no cooperation between the sailings. Sometimes a delay of a few hours could make a two-week delay in the information transmission with a chain effect for the rest of the year.

The engineers were experienced in the profession and their assistants were bred in the trade. In short, the primary injunction of safety was carried out with a thoroughness hitherto unknown to the sea.’ (Babcock, 54)</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a289" id="b289">289</a> Hargest notes that the ‘Cunarders’ made additional savings possible: ‘Their relatively fast crossings, together with the regularity and certainty of their sailings, were obviating the necessity for sending many duplicate copies of the same letter by different ships in order to be certain that a copy would arrive as early as possible, or would arrive at all.’ See Hargest<em>,</em> 2. – Duplicates played no further role in Rathbone’s correspondence in the 1850s.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a290" id="b290">290</a> In addition to the Dramatic Line, there was also another later established packet company on the New York – Liverpool route: the Red Cross Line, established in 1844.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a293" id="b293">293</a> The <em>Queen of the West</em> was one of the finest sailing packets of the time. She was a new 1,160-ton vessel (the Cunarders were 1,150 tons) that had sailed from New York to Liverpool in 15 days in February of the same year. According to Cutler, packets of that size and finish – ‘floating palaces’ – cost $100,000 and upwards, which was nearly double the cost of the average packets of the thirties. See Cutler (1967), 254–257, 378.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a294" id="b294">294</a> The <em>Great Western</em> was in non-regular North Atlantic service up to December 1846; the American ship <em>Massachusetts</em> made two round trips in 1846; and the <em>Sarah Sands</em> was in traffic 1847–1849, making three more round-trips in 1852. See Tabeart (1997), 19–20. The <em>Sarah Sands</em> was the second ocean-going iron screw steamer after the <em>Great Britain</em>, and was chartered by the Red Cross Line, one of the New York packet lines of the later period. According to Bonsor, ‘it can certainly be said that they [her trips] were a success as nearly all her passages were considerably faster than those of contemporary sailing packets, which were what she was intended to compete with rather than with the Cunard wooden paddle-steamers’. The <em>Sarah Sands</em> was also the first steamer to carry emigrants. For example, in August 1848, she was reported to have departed from Liverpool with 60 first class, 46 second class and 200 steerage passengers. In 1852 she arrived in New York with 124 cabin and 238 steerage passengers. See Bonsor (1975), vol. 1, 184–185; and Arnell (1986), 205.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a305" id="b305">305</a> The Collins Line’s contract was a political question from the very beginning. In the U.S. Congress it was strongly opposed by Senators from Ohio and Missouri as being only a waste of money, but warmly supported by Senators from New England, and especially from New York. One of the strongest arguments for the contract was borrowed from the British: government-controlled vessels could be transformed into warships if needed. At the time of the discussion, the United States was at war with Mexico, and the relationship with Britain had its critical moments in the 1840s. (Tyler, 136–138, 145–146) There was a new discussion in the Congress about the Collins contract in 1852 and once more in 1855. See <em>Speech of Mr. Edson B. Olds, of Ohio, on the Collins Line of Steamers, delivered in the House of Representatives, February 15, 1855</em> (Washington, 1855), passim. – Edson B.

In fact, at that time the Cunard Line had not made a scheduled call at Halifax on the way to New York for over four years. On four occasions during 1851–1853, a Cunard vessel had put into Halifax for coal after an extra long voyage due to westerly gales. (See sailing lists of Arnell (1980), 310–312) – Regarding the Boston route, what was said was principally correct. – On the whole, these calculations regarding coal consumption should perhaps not be taken too literally. The Cunard Line’s <em>Asia</em> coaled 850 tons on average for a westward trip in 1851–1853, normally having an average 125 tons left from the eastbound passage. Thus a trip to New York was started with an average amount of 975 tons of coal. The <em>Asia</em> was 600 tons smaller than the Collins vessels and made her westbound trips in about 12 days on average. (Calculated from <em>Cunard Passage Book 1</em>, years 1851–1853, in CP, GM 2/1, SJ)</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a341" id="b341">341</a> Tyler, 209. The Collins Line’s own figures for the round trip cost were even higher, from $63,000 to over $65,000. (<em>Speech of Mr. Edson B.

The Collins Line made 370 Atlantic crossings in total while the Cunard Line made 336 voyages between Liverpool and New York during this period. In 1855 the Cunard Line did not have a service to New York as several of the ships had been conscripted as troop carriers in the Crimean War.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a419" id="b419">419</a> The Mediterranean service was started in the early 1850s with traffic between Britain and the Mediterranean, and was separated from the North Atlantic business when a company named the British and Foreign Steam Navigation Company was formed in 1855. Both companies had the same owner families. Other prospects for a geographical enlargement of services were also considered at that time as the competition with the Collins Line was very tight. These considerations included a plan to start a steamship line to Australia. See Hyde (1975), 16–26.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a427" id="b427">427</a> Tyler, 340–341. – Milne gives a different view of the new contracts: ‘Inman’s co-operation with Cunard in 1868 was a subtle maneuver, gaining a new source of revenue for his own operation while greatly reducing the subsidy available to his key competitor. Cunard in turn had to co-operate because the alternative might have been worse: with official thinking turning in the direction of reduced subsidies, Cunard had to appear reasonable.’ (Milne 2000, 174)</p>

There may be other than Liverpool (– Queenstown) – New York mail sailings included in Bonsor’s figures, e.g. the Inman Line’s sailings via Halifax or the Cunard Line’s sailings from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a436" id="b436">436</a> The <em>Batavia</em>, the <em>Abyssinia</em>, the <em>Algeria</em> and the <em>Parthia</em>, all between 2,500 and 3,500 tons and with accommodation for 800 to 1,000 steerage passengers, were launched in 1870. Three more ships – the <em>Atlas</em> of about 2,500 tons and 800 in steerage, as well as the <em>Bothnia</em> and the <em>Scythia</em>, both of 4,500 tons and carrying 1,100 in steerage – were built for the North Atlantic route between 1873 and 1875.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a438" id="b438">438</a> But the companies had had an agreement about fixed freight rates and minimum passenger rates to protect the British shipping lines against foreign competition since 1867 or early 1868. The National, Guion, Allan and Anchor lines also joined this agreement. See Hyde (1975), 94.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a439" id="b439">439</a> The length of the two unlucky voyages was originally given to Liverpool. To be comparable with the rest of the figures, these voyages have been calculated in the table as 16 and 26 days to Queenstown, even though the ships proceeded directly to Liverpool. One day has also been subtracted from the duration of the voyage in those cases where Hubbard &amp; Winter only record the date of arrival at Liverpool. (In these cases, the ships have probably not been able to call at Queenstown due to bad weather or other reasons.) There was one such case in the Cunard Line’s operations on the New York run that year (and five on the Boston run), and eight cases in the Inman Line’s performance, including the two long voyages.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a441" id="b441">441</a> These two were not the only important transatlantic steamship lines established in the early 1870s. The Holland-America Line (Nederlandsche-Amerikaanische Stoomvart Maatschappijj) established in 1872 and sailing between Hellevoetsluis and New York, the Red Star Line (International Navigation Company of Philadelphia) established in 1873 and sailing mainly between Philadelphia and Antwerp, and the American Line (American Steamship Company) established in 1873 and sailing between Philadelphia and Queenstown–Liverpool need to be mentioned. As they all served on different routes and in only a few years covered by this study, they are not examined here. Their sailing lists up to 1875 are available in Hubbard &amp; Winter, 335–346. The history of the Red Star Line and the American Line, later merged with the Inman Line, is well covered by William Henry Flayhart III in <em>The American Line (1871</em>–<em>1902)</em> (New York, London, 2000). See also Bonsor (1979), vol. 3, 885–887 for the early years of the Holland-America Line, Bonsor (1975), vol. 2, 829–835 for the Red Star Line, and N.R.P.

See Gardiner, 26–28.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a443" id="b443">443</a> The ship names <em>Arctic</em> and <em>Pacific</em> were changed to <em>Republic</em> and <em>Celtic</em> (launched in 1872) due to the tragic associations the company believed the names might invoke among the public. See Fox, 241; Bonsor (1975), vol. 1, 733. – As if to continue the Collins traditions, the White Star Line’s <em>Atlantic</em> was wrecked in April 1873 with the loss of 585 hands, thus adding new sad figures to the company’s own record of worst disasters at sea – to be continued 39 years later when the White Star flagship <em>Titanic</em> sank with the well known consequences. For descriptions of the loss of the <em>Atlantic</em>, see Gardiner 86–89; Flayhart (2003), 39–55.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a444" id="b444">444</a> The company’s early operations under the name Compagnie Général Maritime were affected by financial problems and the Crimean War.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a446" id="b446">446</a> Considerable savings in fuel and increased cargo space made the company change this policy later, and they built new screw steamers and rebuilt the old paddle-wheelers. See Bonsor (1978), vol. 2, 619–625.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a447" id="b447">447</a> In the 1860s, the French Line services were limited by a series of wars: the American Civil war, the Mexican war and the Franco-Prussian war. See Barbance, 73–84; Haws, 8–9.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a451" id="b451">451</a> Bonsor assumes that the company was not authorized to carry steerage passengers on board the New York mail steamers between 1871 and 1879. See Bonsor (1978), vol. 2, 628. – Additionally, the number of emigrants from France was rather low on the whole, compared with several other countries. See O’Rourke &amp; Williamson, 155; Kenwood &amp; Lougheed, 57–61; and Tyler, 362.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a452" id="b452">452</a> After a tolerable duration of a voyage had been ensured, the speed was not necessarily the most important aspect for the passengers. A passenger survey carried on Liverpool ships in 1882 and 1883 showed that faster ships attracted no more bookings than slower ones of the same line. In fact, the fastest express liners were not usually the most comfortable ships for travelling. Such White Star liners as <em>Oceanic</em> and <em>Celtic</em>, or later <em>Olympic</em> and <em>Titanic</em>, the HAPAG steamers <em>Amerika</em> and <em>Kaiserin Auguste Victoria</em>, or the French liners <em>France</em> and <em>Paris</em> are examples of luxurious ships that were not even built to be the fastest vessels on the route. See Hyde (1975), 74; and Kludas, 25–26.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a453" id="b453">453</a> The <em>Germanic</em> made the westbound trip at an average speed of 14.65 knots in 1875 and improved her record to 15.76 knots in 1877. See Kludas, 146–147.</p>

One major shipping line excluded for this reason is the Anchor Line, which had three ships on the North Atlantic route in 1860, 18 ships in 1870 and 25 ships in 1880 (Staff, 135). Chartered ships with only one to three round trips for the mail-carrying companies are also excluded from the figures.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a462" id="b462">462</a> The <em>Adriatic</em> made only one trip for the Collins Line before the collapse of the company. She was later owned and chartered by different shipping companies. She carried U.S. mail on five round voyages for the North Atlantic Steamship Company, which closed down in early 1861. During the Civil War she was used as a troop carrier. See Staff, 129–137; Hubbard &amp; Winter, 271.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a463" id="b463">463</a> This unfortunate period ended in the 1880s after long internal discussions and, finally, a change in the company’s policy. To start a major shipbuilding programme for larger and faster vessels able to compete in the North Atlantic business, the company was publicly listed in 1880 with the name Cunard Steam Ship Co Ltd. See Hyde (1975), 24.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a464" id="b464">464</a> Trip one in Diagram 35 was the <em>Oceanic’s</em> last voyage, and trip four was the <em>Belgic’s</em> last voyage.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a466" id="b466">466</a> See Fox, 106–109. – The companies generally paid more attention to regularity than safety, as the mail contracts often included monetary sanctions in case of delays. For concrete examples, see e.g. Arnell (1980), 181–182. – The passengers were naturally worried about their safety and some measures were taken to calm them. ‘These steamers carry Phillip’s Patent Fire Annihilators. An experienced Surgeon is attached to each steamer’, announced the Inman Line in an advertisement in the <em>Liverpool Mercury</em> 13.10.1854. In 1874, after several fatal shipwrecks in the Atlantic within a short period, the American Line announced: ‘All steamers are fitted with Life Rafts, in addition to the extra number of Life Boats and Life Preservers.’ See <em>Lloyd’s List</em> 9.10.1874.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a467" id="b467">467</a> The Allan Line lost the following vessels in shipwrecks on the Liverpool – Quebec/Portland mail route: <em>Canadian (I)</em> 1857, <em>Indian</em> 1859, <em>Hungarian</em> 1860, <em>Canadian (II)</em> 1861, <em>North Briton</em> 1861, <em>Anglo-Saxon</em> 1863, <em>Norwegian</em> 1863, <em>Bohemian</em> 1864 and <em>Jura</em> 1864. Most of the disasters took place off the rocky and foggy Canadian coast, but the line even managed to lose one of their vessels as a result of a mishap in the River Mersey at Liverpool. See Bonsor (1980), vol. 5, 1888–1889; and Hubbard &amp; Winter, 131–144.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a468" id="b468">468</a> The total number of lost passenger steamers was 65. Of these, 36 were lost while carrying mails under government contract. In addition, 14 of these ships carried mail occasionally. For example, the Anchor Line, not listed by Hubbard &amp; Winter but mentioned as a potential mail carrier by Staff, lost 11 passenger ships on the North Atlantic run during that period. The Inman Line lost six ships during the period, but two of the disasters took place before the company had a mail contract. The loss of the pioneering steamer <em>President</em> in 1841 has been added to the figure as she carried American mails. See Bonsor (1980), vol. 5, 1888–1890; Hubbard &amp; Winter, 195–196; and Staff, 135. Hubbard and Winter have listed all the sailings of steamship lines with a mail contract.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a470" id="b470">470</a> There are several examples of mail sailings that ended in returning to port under canvas. The sails were used in these kinds of situations as late as the 1870s, 40 years after the invention of ocean steam power. See Hubbard &amp; Winter, 18, 49, 62, 80, 98, 113; 277, 278, etc.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a475" id="b475">475</a> During 36 years, Cunard Line’s ships ran aground at least eight times in addition to the two shipwrecks. However, no repairs were needed in four of the eight times. The ships were involved in at least two collisions and once struck a submerged object, thought to be a whale. Two delays were caused by non-detailed storm damage and ten delays by broken machinery. At least 23 major delays were caused by fog, ice or snowstorms. Additionally, Cunard ships were reported to have passed Queenstown without calling in due to heavy weather at least five times during the period. See Hubbard &amp; Winter, 17–80. – Even if these lists are far from perfect, they give an overall picture of the reasons for delays in the mail service and the different shipping company profiles. During the first 75 years of its existence, Cunard Line made thousands of round trips across the Atlantic and lost only three ships, no passengers, and almost no mail.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a476" id="b476">476</a> An average Collins Line trip westwards – including the <em>ad hoc</em> voyages by chartered steamers in 1857 – took 12.4 days, while an average westbound voyage of all contract mail steamers on that route in 1875 took 11.3 days.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a491" id="b491">491</a> Large, 18. – <em>Lloyd’s List</em> commonly reported that ships were arriving ‘off Holyhead’ or ‘off Liverpool’. Especially after the railway had been opened for the whole distance between Liverpool and London, the news of a ship’s arrival off Holyhead was published in London before the vessel was in the port of Liverpool. Another news service speeded up by the telegraph was the ‘Vessels spoken with’ also published in <em>Lloyd’s List</em>. It included information about vessels met at sea: the name of the ship and her captain, port of origin and destination, as well as the longitude and latitude where met at sea. When comparing the contents of ‘Vessels spoken with’ and the published information on ship arrivals, it seems evident that many of the reports were sent by the optical telegraph system while the ship was still at sea.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a496" id="b496">496</a> Large, 115. – According to Large, there were also many practical problems to be solved. Land owners were unhappy with the wires crossing their fields, and submarine cables caused constant difficulties even in the 1860s. Additionally, the communications between ships at sea and the telegraph on land was still based on flags and other good old-fashioned systems which needed eye-sight. The wireless telegraph later used by ships would be invented only at the end of the century. (Large, 115–117) The existing semaphore system probably also gave some advantage to the Liverpool merchants in receiving news from the sea before it was forwarded to London. This benefit was not long-lived, however. In the early 1850s, an electric telegraph line was built between Holyhead and Chester along the railway. In addition, a direct telegraph line existed between London and Liverpool from 1851. (Kieve, 49, 55, 82)</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a497" id="b497">497</a> Large, 14; Risberg, 64. – According to Reid, the Hamburg–Cuxhaven telegraph line, built by two Americans, Charles Robinson and Charles L. Chapin by using relay technology, worked better than the Wheatstone system. (Reid, 85)</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a499" id="b499">499</a> Kieve, 68, 73. –The Electric Telegraph Company had been established in 1846 on the basis of Cooke’s and Wheatstone’s patents to build the telegraph in cooperation with the railway companies, while the English &amp; Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company was established in 1851 to provide links between England and Ireland by submarine telegraph. It was merged with the British Electric Telegraph Company in 1856, forming the British &amp; Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company. Its technology was based on magnetic electricity. The company’s head office was in Liverpool, and there was a strong provincial and commercial interest among the local shareholders and directors. (Kieve, 43–44, 54, 269) – Britain nationalized the telegraph companies in 1868–1869 and the Post Office took over the businesses. See Kieve, 138–175. The new arrangements included a uniform one shilling rate for 20 words, independent of the distance, following the model of the uniform one penny postage rate. As a result, the number of sent telegrams increased in Britain from about 6,500,000 in 1869 to 19,250,000 in 1875 (calculated from mid-1874 to mid-1875). Such expansion was not seen in any other country. See Kieve 162–163, 183. The maximum inland rates had been reduced from ten to four shillings in the early 1850s, and one shilling rates had been introduced by minor competitors already in the early 1860s. (Kieve, 53, 64)</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a500" id="b500">500</a> The technological solutions varied greatly in different countries. Instead of the different needle systems, the line opened between St. Petersburg and Helsinki in 1855 was based on Morse’s invention. (Risberg, 75–84). About Morse’s discoveries and the development of his electro-magnetic telegraph, see Reid, 48–111.</p>

Even if known in Europe by the mid-17th century, its excellent insulating and underwater conductor qualities were only discovered in the late 1840s. It was used for the insulation of submarine cables for almost a century until challenged by modern synthetic plastics based on polyethylene by 1950. See Garrett, 6; Kieve 101–102.</p>

See Oliver Woods &amp; James Bishop, <em>The Story of The Times</em> (London, 1983), 90. This use must have been mainly experimental, however, as the telegraph lines were mainly built a few years later. – According to Kieve, it was Julius Reuter who was ‘probably the first man to see the immense advantages of the use of the telegraph for newspapers and had established an office in London 1851’.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a511" id="b511">511</a> To get a good overall idea of the building of the first Atlantic cable, Garratt’s short history is very useful. See Garratt, 14–22. Two recent books give very different perspectives: Gordon’s <em>A Thread Across the Ocean...</em> highlights Cyrus W. Field’s role in the project, while Gillian Cookson’s <em>The Cable. The Wire that Changed the World</em> (Gloucestershire, 2003) gives a more balanced picture of the development that led to the final breakthrough of fast Atlantic communications. See Gordon and Cookson, passim. See also Kieve, 105–115. About Morse’s role in the project, see Cookson, 56–57, 60–63, 69–70, 72. Reid put it this way: ‘Faraday and Morse encouraged the American projector [Cyrus W. Field]. But scientific and practical men were so divided, that it was difficult to inspire the degree of confidence necessary to success.’ He continued: ‘In face of all these obstacles, Mr. Field went to London, and succeeded in 1856 in organizing the first Atlantic Telegraph Company, and raising the necessary money to carry out the project, subscribing himself for more than one-quarter of the entire capital.’ (Reid, 519) British sources give a rather different picture of Field’s role as an investor in the project.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a522" id="b522">522</a> Sailing lists of Hubbard &amp; Winter, 178, 208. – The Electric and the Magnetic had contracted with Reuter’s in January 1859 for the exclusive rights to supply foreign telegrams to all towns in the UK. Reuter’s retained the exclusive right of supplying commercial and shipping news within 15 miles of London (the former were prohibited from passing it on to newspapers or public rooms). In February 1865 the telegraph companies (including the minor United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company) formed a combined news and intelligence department under the direction of a joint committee and managed by Charles Boys of the Electric. As the companies had a monopoly of the telegraph communications of the UK, newspapers requiring news by telegraph were compelled to resort to them for it, and take what they were willing to supply. The smaller newspapers were possibly satisfied, but the larger ones were not as they continually attacked the telegraph companies. This dissatisfaction would be one of the major factors in the nationalisation of the telegraph system. (Kieve, 71–72)</p>

Each company had their own code books, and the telegrams had to be interpreted on both sides of the Atlantic: first to the cipher language and then back to English again. Examples of telegrams with opened cipher codes can be found e.g. from C.K. Prioleau’s correspondence in the business records of Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Co. at the MMM (B/FT, box 2). – The use of codes also caused confusion and delays: ‘What is penance in Charleston code.

To reduce costs, the operators sometimes employed young girls with small salaries. They made free translations and left out what they could not read. Commercial terms were unknown to them and they gave new terms to trade. (Reid, 780)</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a530" id="b530">530</a> Garratt, 38. – JoAnne Yates has compared the information costs by ordinary mail and telegraph in American companies. According to her, the companies could exert more central authority over their agents by insisting e.g. that no unauthorized price cuts should be made or that rush orders had to be confirmed with the headquarters. In such cases, the high cost of sending a telegram was justified as the use of the telegraph led to savings in the company’s business. The study does not cover overseas information transmission. See JoAnne Yates, ‘Investing in Information: Supply and Demand Forces in the Use of Information in American Firms, 1850–1920’ in Peter Temin (ed.) <em>Inside the Business Enterprise.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch006.xhtml#a531" id="b531">531</a> Richard B. Kielbowicz has noticed the same in the inland news-gathering of American newspapers: only hard facts were transmitted by telegraph while the rest was sent by ordinary mail. Also the U.

Earlier, all cotton handled by a merchant, whether as owner or consignee, was sold through his selling broker to a buying broker who acted for the spinner. The few powerful spinners who imported cotton themselves employed brokers. The cables facilitated the spinner-importing, and also produced a fusion of broker-merchant, who both imported and sold, thus leaving the middlemen out. See J.H.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a578" id="b578">578</a> The other sample of letters from 1826–1841 show that both merchant houses, Sandbach, Tinne &amp; Co. as well as Thomas and William Earle &amp; Co., usually often received duplicates from their plantations in Guiana. Seven of the 15 letters in this sample are duplicates, five of them in Sandbach’s correspondence and two in Earle’s. Interestingly, both duplicates in the latter collection are from 1841, as if the practice would then have been introduced at the plantation. Subsequently, at least three letters out of 11 in Earle’s correspondence from 1842 are duplicates. As the whole sample consists of only 36 letters from 1825–1842, they can naturally only give examples of business practices and can by no means be interpreted as full evidence of the companies’ policies in this question. See Records of Sandbach, Tinne &amp; Co., D/B/176; Correspondence of Thomas and William Earle &amp; Co, D/Earle/5/2. (MMM). – There could naturally also be other reasons for sending duplicates than just getting the message through as fast as possible. For instance, something new could have happened since the original letter was sent: ‘I have already written to you to this packet but since posting my letter, I have seen W.B. Chisholm. I had a long &amp; interesting conversation with him…’ (William Carter to William Earle, Berbice 23.1.1842, ‘p. Packet’. Correspondence of Thomas and William Earle &amp; Co, D/Earle/5/8/4b, MMM).</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a579" id="b579">579</a> Brown &amp; Duguid have pointed out that it was finally the telegraph, linking the European capitals to their overseas colonies, which radically reduced the independence of the overseas administrators.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a583" id="b583">583</a> This practice was well known by the General Post Office and the Treasury, and became part of a lively parliamentary debate in 1838 in connection with the General Post Master’s plan to uniform the inland postage rates, which were based on miles carried, to one penny. Simultaneously with this reform in 1840, the rates of incoming private ship letters were uniformed to 8d per oz., covering the transmission from the exit port of the country of origin to the addressee anywhere on the British Isles. See Robertson, C2; and <em>BPP, Transports and Communications, Posts and Telegraphs 1 and 2</em> (1838). Select Committee on Postage, passim. – In the sample of 1825–1841, six letters had arrived via the Post Office: two via Glasgow, two via Deal, one via Plymouth and one to Sandbach, Tinne &amp; Co. through the Liverpool Post Office, carrying the ‘LIVERPOOL SHIP LETTER’ handstamp. Six letters were forwarded to the recipient by the captain, two duplicates privately, and one remained unknown as the cover was not included in the records. There were paid and non-paid letters in both companies’ correspondence. See D/B/176; D/Earle/5/2 (MMM) and HHC.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a585" id="b585">585</a> The total number of other British ship departures and arrivals was approximately 10% of the whole. Of these other ports, Bristol and Plymouth had the most traffic to Guiana but still less than 20 sailings in total.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a586" id="b586">586</a> An exact number of vessels cannot be given, as there were several ships by the same name and insufficient other details.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a587" id="b587">587</a> E.g. the <em>Lady Campbell’s</em> arrival in Liverpool 6.5.1840 was published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em> on 7.5.1840. Her departure from Demerara (14.3.1840) was published almost a week later, 13.5.1840. The <em>Palmyra’s</em> arrival in Liverpool 1.7.1840 was published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em> 2.7.1840 and her departure from Demerara (26.5.) a week later, 9.7.1840. It could also happen that the news of the ship’s departure from the colonial port and arrival at the homeport were published in the same issue, and even on the very same page, like when <em>Lloyd’s List</em> published the departure of the <em>Thistle</em> from Demerara (23.8.) and her arrival at Clyde 22.9.1840, on 23.9.1840. Quite often this problem has been avoided by a note in the arrivals: ‘sailed ...’ thus combining the two different news types.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a588" id="b588">588</a> Three trips with durations between 82 and 97 days have been left out of the calculation, as they most probably were not direct sailings.</p>

This variation of voyages was also noticed by Steele, although he looks at it from the perspective of English ports. As he also remarked, the West Indian mail packets demonstrated that ships could safely sail on the route regardless of the seasons. See Steele (1986), 23, 286, 290.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a597" id="b597">597</a> <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, 1840. The mails had earlier been sent on the first and third Wednesday of each month from London, the packets leaving from Falmouth on the following Saturday, but this somewhat confusing system had been adjusted in 1834. The mails were now made in the London Post Office on the 1st and 15th of each month. If these dates happened to be Sundays, the departure from Falmouth consequently took place on the 4th and 18th. See Britnor, 149–152.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a598" id="b598">598</a> To be consistent, this calculation is based on data concerning packets by which it was possible to send mail to Britain from the West Indies in 1840. Thus, the <em>Tyrian</em> was the first packet included. She departed from Falmouth on 4 December, 1839 and arrived at Barbados on 16 January, 1840. The <em>Ranger</em> was the last packet of the next 12 months, departing from Falmouth in November, 1840. She was back in Falmouth on 12 February, 1841.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a599" id="b599">599</a> In three cases, the date of the stop at Barbados is missing, making it impossible to calculate the duration of the westbound and inter-islands journeys.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a605" id="b605">605</a> See Howat, 1–6. – In practice, the system was more complicated. On those journeys starting from Falmouth in January–June each year, the packets called at Bahia and Pernambuco on their homeward voyage. On the journeys commencing from Falmouth in the second half of the year, Bahia and Pernambuco were touched at the outward voyage. And in 1832, when the Post Office service to South America was totally taken over by the Admiralty, this was adjusted once more so that the respective months were February–July and August–January. See Howat, 65. The reason for the odd six-month arrangement was simply that the running order of the South American ports of call depended on the prevailing winds. See Pawlyn, 111.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a608" id="b608">608</a> In 1830, there was a double service to South America, conducted by both the Post Office and the Admiralty. The Post Office packet sailings covered the route Falmouth – Rio de Janeiro – Montevideo – Buenos Aires – Montevideo – Rio de Janeiro – Falmouth and did not make a call at Bahia or Pernambuco. Their average home voyage from Rio took 51.3 days. (Howat, 61) In three cases, the mails were transferred from the packet to a man-of-war in Rio, however. These changes caused serious protests among the local merchants as well as the Post Office in England due to confusion in sailing schedules and differences in postage rates. See Howat, 54–55.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a610" id="b610">610</a> See the list of Admiralty packets in Howat, 32–35. It is a more complete list than the one in <em>Lloyd’s Register</em> 1840. – The longer route via Bahia and Pernambuco on homeward sailings half of the year did not explain the difference. There were new and old vessels on both routes, and the new ones were typically faster on both routes throughout the year. See the sailing lists of Howat, 81. – As an exception to the rule mentioned, the <em>Seagull</em> which was the last Falmouth packet in service was of middle-size, 280 tons.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a611" id="b611">611</a> This opportunity remained occasional even in 1850, when it was possible only three times out of 12 to send an answer to a letter by an earlier departing packet. Additionally, one packet left on the same day when the packet from England arrived, thus giving only a slight opportunity to somebody close to the port to send an answer to a letter by that vessel. See sailing lists of Howat, 85–86.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a614" id="b614">614</a> See Howat, 27; Kenton &amp; Parsons, 2–3, 8, 21. – There was also a French government mail packet line between Bordeaux and Vera Cruz in 1827–1835. The monthly service of the ‘Paquebots Réguliers aux frais du Gouvernement’ was ceased in mid-1835. The last ship was to sail from Bordeaux for Martinique, Haiti and Vera Cruz on 1.7.1835. A new service was started by Compagnie Général Transatlantique’s steamers as late as 1862. The early French sailing packet service enabled about the same information circulation from Bordeaux to Vera Cruz as the Falmouth packet service did from England. A round trip normally took about five months and two information circles could be carried out in 11 months. Salles gives the departure and arrival dates from Bordeaux but no arrivals and only a few departure dates from Vera Cruz, which makes it impossible to reconstruct the information circles enabled by the service on that route at the period. Apart from the possibility to send a message by an earlier leaving packet, which remains unknown, the missing intelligence makes it impossible to compare any options to send mail to Europe by the French <em>or</em> the British service.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a616" id="b616">616</a> Britnor, 150. – As can be seen in table 40, several Falmouth packets called at Belize again in 1840. Continuous changes were typical on these routes.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a617" id="b617">617</a> In addition to the packets mentioned in this table, the <em>Pigeon</em> arrived from Vera Cruz at Falmouth on 15.1.1840 with $200,000; the <em>Reindeer</em> on 15.4.1840 with $580,000; and the <em>Delight</em> on 30.4.1840 with $250,000.

For further descriptions, see Bushell, 41–53.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a645" id="b645">645</a> See the sailing lists of Kenton &amp; Parsons, 26–32. The respective intelligence of <em>Lloyd’s List</em> varies somewhat from these lists. According to <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, the <em>Thames</em> arrived from Bermuda on the 19th and not the 18th. According to Kenton &amp; Parsons, it was the <em>Tay</em> which sailed for Jamaica 24.11. while according to <em>Lloyd’s List</em> it was the <em>Trent</em>. <em>Lloyd’s List</em> does not report the <em>Dee’s</em> trip to Jamaica between 8.–23.11. None of the sources tell from where the <em>Tweed</em> arrived at St. Thomas on 23.11. or where the <em>Trent</em> proceeded after 23.11. Kenton &amp; Parsons’ sailing lists are largely based on maritime intelligence published in Caribbean newspapers, which were nearer the scene but might be less reliable for other reasons – <em>Lloyd’s List</em> again was published far away in London and changes were possible after the intelligence was sent by the Lloyd’s agent. For the references, see Kenton &amp; Parsons, 415–417. (Also <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, <em>The Times</em> and <em>Illustrated London News</em> are among their sources.) – Without knowing the original plans for sailings – if any – it is impossible to interpret from the sailing lists whether the inter-island vessels were on schedule or not. For example, Nicol mentions that the <em>Clyde</em> was at Nassau on 17 February nine days behind schedule. (Nicol, vol. 2, 25) The sailing lists can only tell that the ship arrived at Nassau on 16 and departed on 20 February. Thus, we can only see from the sailing lists where the ships have been, not where they <em>should</em> have been at that time.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a653" id="b653">653</a> Sailing lists of Kenton &amp; Parsons, 13, 28. – The Jamaica mails in April should have been carried by one of the two steamers, <em>Forth</em> or <em>Tay</em>, which both decided to sail home instead.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a654" id="b654">654</a> From October 1842, the Royal Mail mail steamers would ‘no longer touch at New Orleans, Savannah, Charleston, New York, Halifax N.S., Curacoa, Paramaribo in Surinam, Maracaibo, Bahia Honda, San Juan de Nicaragua, Mayaquess in Porto Rico, Ponce in Porto Rico, Turks’ Island, Cape Nichola Mole in Haiti, or Santa Cruz’. The mails for Mexico, Honduras (Belize), Chagres and the Isthmus of Panama, Cartagena, Santa Martha, La Guayara and Puerto Cabello would be made only once in a month instead of a bi-monthly service. Mail transmission by schooner between Madeira and Fayal would also be omitted. (‘Notice to the Public and Instructions to all Postmasters... General Post Office 12th September, 1842’, reprinted by Kenton &amp; Parsons, 24.) – In June 1843, the system was adjusted again. The packets would no longer touch at Cape Haitien, St. Domingo, but instead at Jacmel on the same island. On the home voyage, Bermuda and Fayal would be touched only alternatively. (‘Notice to the Public and Instructions to all Postmasters... General Post Office, June 1843’, reprinted by Kenton &amp; Parsons, 34.) With these changes, the company managed to conduct the mail service until the end of the first contract in 1847, except for the several months of ‘emergency plans’ caused by the loss of the <em>Tweed</em> in February 1847, as there was no vessel to replace her. See Kenton &amp; Parsons, 73–78.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a657" id="b657">657</a> There were also other reasons to reduce the number of calls at St. Thomas. Despite its excellent harbour and ideal geographical situation, St. Thomas had some serious disadvantages. It was situated in the middle of the hurricane region. In 1867, when the Royal Mail Line used the island as the hub where its steamers entered simultaneously for the mails, several of the vessels with some 150 men were lost in a hurricane, which sank 58 of the 60 vessels anchored at Charlotte Amalie that morning. An earthquake, followed by a huge tidal wave – tsunami – caused additional damage at the same port only a few weeks later. St. Thomas was furthermore avoided because of the frequent yellow fever and cholera epidemics. See Bushell, 115–124; Kenton &amp; Parsons, 246–250.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a665" id="b665">665</a> The duration of the port stay was originally one week but it was lengthened already in mid-1851 to give more time for the answers. Due to poor inland connections the additional time was really needed and was not even enough in many cases. The change did not affect the schedule homewards from Rio de Janeiro. See the sailing lists of Howat, 129.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a669" id="b669">669</a> Nicol, vol. 1, 64. – The trip was not too comfortable for the first years’ passengers. Apart from the normal disadvantages of being at sea during that time period, the South American port facilities were not in place yet. Bushell describes the conditions: ‘The well-planned Avenidas, the fine buildings, hotels, warehouses and quays which have made Rio de Janeiro into one of the fairest cities in the world, had not yet come into being. The ‘Esk’s’ [Royal Mail Line’s first steamer to arrive, she would become the branch steamer between Rio, Montevideo and Buenos Aires] passengers stepped ashore into a town of narrow, evil-smelling streets, of stagnant pools, rotting garbage and foul drains which are said to have repelled even the hard-bitten British seamen of those days. After a brief stay, the ‘Esk’ set off again southward, called at Monte Video and entered the muddy waters of the River Plate... In the early days, the Royal Mail steamer anchored about 7 miles off the city [Buenos Aires]. The passengers and mails were transferred to a tiny steamer which took them to a point about two miles off shore. Here a second transhipment took place into a whale boat which was sailed, or rowed, close in-shore. When about 200 yards off the beach, the long-suffering passengers were again transferred, this time to a horse-drawn cart which finally landed them at a tiny wooden jetty. If the weather were at all unpropitious, the landing at Buenos Aires must have been the most formidable experience of the whole passage.’ See Bushell, 58.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a675" id="b675">675</a> These are average figures calculated from the sample. Additionally, it took 31 days on average for the letters to arrive by the transatlantic steamer from Rio de Janeiro in Liverpool.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a676" id="b676">676</a> This example is partly based on the Williams correspondence, partly on the sailing lists of Howat, 131. There are practically no outward letters at all preserved in the archives, and letter books are not useful as they lack all postal markings, as well as notes of arrival dates. – In fact, Daniel Williams did not receive on 13 April any of the letters which arrived in Southampton on the 12th although he should have received them if they had been addressed to Liverpool. His villa address in Ormskirk was a continuous problem for the local post offices. For instance the letter from Herbidero had circulated an extra three days in the surroundings before its final arrival. It bears the following post office handstamps and markings: arrival in London 13.4.; Liverpool 14.4.; Birkenhead 14.4.; New Brighton 15.4.; note by hand: ‘not known at New Brighton’; and finally the recipient’s note 15.4.1856. Another point to note is that all the mails were not handled in London on the same day. While the contents of the Montevideo mailbag – with the letter from Herbidero – had been handstamped there 13.4., the letter from Rio Grande, which was in the Rio de Janeiro mailbag, was handstamped in the London Post Office already 12.4. and in Liverpool 13.4. Daniel Williams received that letter in Ormskirk already on 14.4.1856. (Daniel Williams correspondence, D/B/176, MMM)</p>

Although slower, this was a safer route and the entire voyage was conducted under a neutral flag. See John Haskell Kemble, <em>The Panama Route 1848</em>–<em>1869</em> (Berkeley, 1943), 111.</p>

Doublet also states that there was a line of packets from Liverpool to Valparaiso organized by the South American merchants of Liverpool since 1836. These packets were advertised to sail from Liverpool as follows: to Valparaiso, Islay and Lima (Callao) every three weeks, to Arica, Islay and Lima every two months and to Lima direct every six weeks. The Vice Consul at Tacna (Peru), referred to this service in a letter to Foreign Office in October 1842: ‘…I would recommend all the official despatches to be sent by the direct ships from Liverpool to Arica…’ Nothing more seems to be known about this service. See Doublet, 24. The ships must have been regular traders without government contract. The timing matches with the overall increase of activity by the Liverpool merchant ships, e.g. in East India and Australasia (see Chapter VII.1.) The line model itself was a copy of the American sailing packets on the Liverpool – New York run.</p>

For example, the speed of the Royal Mail steamers with compound engines in the 1870s was 11 to 12 knots, which was normal performance for ships with inverted engines, too. Technically, the 1860s were also the time when the old wooden paddle steamers were changed to iron screws. See the fleet list of the Royal Mail Line in Bonsor (1983), 21–24, Howat, 122.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a771" id="b771">771</a> The factual dates of Messageries Impériales arrivals in South American ports are missing from the sailing lists of Salles, and the homeward sailing dates are given only from Buenos Aires. In a few cases, the comparison between the Daniel Williams correspondence (Bryson Collection, D/B 175, MMM) and the sailing lists give an unusually long transfer time between Bordeaux and Liverpool, four days instead of the normal two. This may indicate that the ship arrival dates in French newspapers could probably be incorrect, as the postal handstamps are to be considered more reliable. This is probable also because there is some non-correspondence between the sailing lists of Salles and Hubbard &amp; Winter concerning the French Line sailings in the North Atlantic in the 1870s. Salles has used French newspapers and shipping company archives as sources, while Hubbard and Winter have used New York papers and <em>Lloyd’s List</em> (Salles, Tome III, 4; Salles, Tome IV, 8, 238–239; Hubbard &amp; Winter, 275, 284–286). But it is also possible that the sailing dates are right and the mail between Bordeaux and Liverpool has been delayed for some reason. In the Howat sailing lists, a few Tait &amp; Co. and Lamport &amp; Holt sailing dates are missing and estimates have been calculated by using Buenos Aires arrival or departure dates. In some cases, Howat has also used dates ‘due to arrive or depart’ instead of factual dates. Additionally, two Liverpool arrival dates have been corrected as the postal handstamps of letters in the Williams correspondence show clearly that the ship did not arrive on the day given. See Howat, 171, 183, 211.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch007.xhtml#a772" id="b772">772</a> For the discussion about the renewal of the mail contract, see Howat, 181–190. – The Post Office also took a survey of the amount of British postage collected on the correspondence carried by the mail lines between South America and Britain during the six months beginning from June 1869. It was noticed that the earnings of the Royal Mail Line, the only company with a fixed subsidy (Messageries Impériales received subsidies from the French government), had not been diminished by the establishment of additional mail lines. Another survey showed that the payments by the Post Office to Lamport &amp; Holt were only £4,834 in 1869 and £5,418 in 1870, which did not indicate large amounts of mails carried. The Pacific Steam Navigation Company’s part was even somewhat smaller, but the company naturally had its role in the Pacific service. The actual earnings by the Royal Mail Line were still £33,100 in 1874, then declining rapidly to £20,828 in 1875, £16,976 in 1876 and being only £5,538 in 1880. See Howat, 128, 170, 181, 209.</p>

The company’s commercial businesses ended with a further abolition of the China trade monopoly in 1833. The last trade vessels sailed back home in 1834. After that, up to the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, the EIC activities in India were focused on the governmental duties of the presidencies, and then ceased. See Cain &amp; Hopkins, 97, 282–288.</p>

The Fifth Report from the Select Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company, 1812, 12. – The military aspects of EIC activities are not discussed here, but to understand the specific role of the Company it may be useful to mention that the EIC’s compensation for military expeditions at the Cape of Good Hope, Ceylon, Manila, Malacca and Molucca during the war was widely discussed in the Parliament. The Company wanted to get compensation for the shipowners for equipping the vessels with provision, wood, gun powder, and wages for the officers and seamen. Although the EIC played an important role in British expansion in Asia, the counterargument against compensation was that the company had also gained remarkable profits e.g. from the spice trade in Ceylon. See <em>BPP, Colonies, East India 2</em> (1810–1812). Third and Fourth Reports from the Select Committee of the Affairs of the East India Company. Appendix 47, 3–7. – The export of opium from India to China caused two Opium Wars between Britain and China, in 1839–1842 and 1856–1858. The importance of this trade can be verified from the export figures. Between 1848 and 1852, the earliest figures available, the export of opium from India was worth 61.5 million rupees on average, while the other exports were valued as follows: cotton 29.4 million, cotton manufactures 7.7 million, jute 1.3 million, jute manufactures 2.0 million, rice 7.6 million, and tea 0.4 million rupees.

Due to the prevailing winds and currents, sailing ships normally called at Madeira on the way outward and at St. Helena on the way home. Thus, letters from London to St. Helena were first carried twice across the Atlantic, via the coast of Brazil to South Africa and from there, after a varying delay at port, by another ship to St. Helena. This took at least four months, but if there were no homeward sailing ships available at the Cape, as often was the case, there could be a further delay of several weeks or even months. On the other hand, letters from St. Helena to London were carried directly in about two months. (Calculated from the maritime intelligence in <em>Lloyd’s List</em> 1812–1813 and 1832–1833.)</p>

Although 135 persons reached shore, none was ever heard of again, except for four of the crew who eventually reached Cape Town by foot. Between 1761 and 1834, eleven of the 541 East Indiamen (the ‘packets’ excluded) disappeared without trace on the voyage. Additionally, 48 were lost at sea, four were condemned for other reasons, 15 were burnt, another 15 were captured by the French, three more were captured but recaptured, and one ship was blown up.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a816" id="b816">816</a> The Liverpool merchants who had led the campaign against the EIC were among the first to send their vessels to India. The first ship, mentioned also in the British Parliamentary Papers in 1831–1832, was John Gladstone’s <em>Kingsmill</em>, which sailed for Calcutta in May 1814. It was followed by two other Liverpool vessels in 1815 and no less than 17 more ships in 1816. In 1832, they already numbered 34.

Appendix to the Report from Select Committee on the Affairs of the East India Company with an Index [II Finance and Accounts] Part II, Commercial, 772, 786. – Not all vessels under the British flag in Indian ports had arrived from England, however. There were dozens of Indian ‘country ships’, carrying the British flag and with British officers and lascar crews, sailing between India and other Asian ports. In addition to exporting cotton, they were also the main carriers of opium to China on behalf of the EIC.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a817" id="b817">817</a> The value of the EIC’s merchandise exports from England to India decreased from £710,700 in 1814–1815 to £71,900 in 1824–1825 and £2,600 in 1826–1827. Moreover, whereas the value of military stores carried by the Company to St. Helena and India was £944,100 in 1826–1827, it had decreased to £92,000 by 1830–1831.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a830" id="b830">830</a> The value of Australian wool exports grew from £35,000 in 1830 to £849,000 in 1840, and to £2,305,000 in 1850. Although wheat exports had also started by 1850, they were worth little for decades. See Mitchell, 649.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a831" id="b831">831</a> Some vessels coming from Australia stayed in the Indian Ocean and China Sea for years as tramp ships without returning to England. Most of the 21 convict ships of 1832, having left their human freight at Sydney or Hobart Town, proceeded to the Asian trading posts. Strikingly often it was just these vessels that were wrecked in bad weather, the cargo being ‘thrown over the board’ or sold locally with the remains of the ship, far away from the sea assurance inspectors at home. Of the six vessels lost during a voyage to or from Australia, five were convict ships on their way back home, while one was an emigrant ship on the way to Australia, which was destroyed by fire off Brazil with heavy loss of life. (The tragic loss of the <em>Hibernia</em> was described in <em>Lloyd’s List</em> 3.5.1833.)</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a832" id="b832">832</a> Liverpool shipping expanded in several directions during the 1830s. For example, the Brocklebanks merchant house increased their sailings not only to Calcutta (from four in 1830 to nine in 1840) and to Bombay (from none in 1830 to four in 1840), but also to ‘Lima etc.’ (from two in 1830 to seven in 1840) and to St. John’s (from two in 1830 to five in 1840). The sailings for India must therefore be seen as a part of the general growth in trade and not as a separate phenomenon. For the Brocklebanks sailings, see John Frederic Gibson, <em>Brocklebanks 1770</em>–<em>1950,</em> Volume I (Liverpool, 1953), 88.</p>

If the ship was sailing for Calcutta but called first at Madras, only the duration of the voyage as far as to Madras has been recorded. Due to the long distance, ships sailing for Calcutta often called at Madeira, the Cape or Mauritius for watering or provisions, which added a few days to the total length of the voyage. The stops are included in the figures. – The averages have been calculated from 36, 14, 43 and 38 voyages respectively. The reason for the low number of home voyages from Madras is that most ships sailed to Calcutta via Madras but home directly, or even if they called at Madras, it was left unreported.</p>

No fewer than 27 arrivals were reported in <em>Lloyd’s List</em> without any date or giving just a ‘previous to’ date which could refer to any date within the previous few weeks. Only ten of the 53 vessels which were reported to have arrived were also reported to have sailed from Hobart Town and Launceston, while only 36 of the 70 vessels which were reported to have arrived were also reported to have sailed from Sydney.</p>

Her mails were landed at Portsmouth on 19.12.1833 and the letters were finally received by the EIC in London on 23.12.1833.

For a useful list, see Thorner’s bibliography, 184–186. – Even as late as 1838, one of the hopeful advocates of the longer sea route, Sir John Ross, Captain of the Royal Navy, published a plan to collect £500,000 capital for a new India Steamship Company for steam communications to India via the Cape. The service was planned to reach only as far as Point-de-Galle in Ceylon, probably to get support from both the Bombay and Calcutta merchants. The continuation of the trip by local means would have made the duration of information transmission equally long to both the main trade ports. Ross calculated that the trip between England and Ceylon would be made in 46 days. The plan included three steamers and two store ships for coaling. See Sir John Ross, <em>On Communication to India in Large Steam-Ships, by the Cape of Good-Hope</em> (London, 1838), 3–44. For the different interests, see Cable, 68–69.</p>

According to the Moubrays, however, the estimated time taken for the whole trip would have been 61 days ‘had there been a steamship to take the mails from Alexandria’.

Its main partners, Brodie McGhie Willcox and Arthur Anderson, were from Ostend (although originating from English-Scottish parents) and Shetland respectively, and were therefore not highly appreciated by the London merchant houses. The main proprietor and shipowner, Richard Bourne, was from Dublin, and in fact some of the first vessels used Liverpool as a branch terminal. About the early history, owners, etc. see Cable, 6–36.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a903" id="b903">903</a> This arrangement was enabled by the Anglo-French postal convention of 1839, which allowed closed mails through France for India. See Sidebottom, 84–90, Tabeart (2002), 187–190. – Tabeart notes that ‘a number of failures by the PSNCo ships slowed the average course of the mails from Malta to Falmouth to 19 days, with a correspondingly poor Alexandria–Falmouth time, averaging 29 days. These compare very unfavourably with the last all-RN figures homewards of 16 ½ and 23 days respectively’. In fact, also the transit times at Malta between the two Royal Navy steamers compared very unfavourably in 1838: instead of the normally one or two days’ transit time at Malta during the ‘all-RN’ service in 1837, it now took three to four days, even six, to get the mails from one Admiralty vessel to another. At Gibraltar, the reasons for lengthened transit times were different. Even if normally smoothly conducted, in four cases the mails were delayed in transit between an Admiralty packet and a PSNCo vessel due to a breakdown of the latter. The delay in these occasions was seven to nine days. For the quote, see Tabeart, (2002), 50, and for the transit dates and notes, 38, 49–52.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a904" id="b904">904</a> Sidebottom, 89. – The convention was a major improvement compared with the earlier period when the charges for a letter to India via Marseilles were 10d. British, 3s. 9d. French plus 1s. steam postage from Suez to Bombay, the total being 5s. 7d. See Tabeart (2002), 187. – The French Post Office had started several steamship lines on the Mediterranean routes in 1837. They carried mail between Marseilles and Malta, Athens, Constantinople, and Alexandria. The service was three times monthly. Yet the Overland service by the French started only in the 1860s, when the Egyptian railway had already been built. For the early French services in the Mediterranean, see Salles, Tome II, 9–35.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a907" id="b907">907</a> Also Tabeart notes the poor connectivity at Malta between the Admiralty packets and the all-sea route via Gibraltar. The Malta–Marseilles packets clearly had priority in the mail service, which was ‘quite understandable – a principle reason for establishing the entire packet network was for the Government to get the earliest possible intelligence from [or to] the far-flung British Empire’.

The EIC service between Suez and Bombay was costing the British and Indian governments no less than £105,000/year at that time. The offer was declined even though it was at that time often quicker to send the mails to Bombay by the P&amp;O service via Calcutta. The matter was hotly debated in the Parliament and the EIC was left in no doubt what the country thought of it. Three years later the EIC lost a complete ship load of mail in the Red Sea; and during the next few years the Bombay–Suez link was gradually transferred to P&amp;O.

The Black Ball Line advertised its Australian service by ‘British and Australian ex-Royal Mail Packets’ after having lost the contract to the steamships in 1857.

Colin Tabeart has collected all the sailing dates of the Australian mail clippers from the contranct period 1855-1856, see Tabeart (2004), 144–160. – There was also a plan to start a mail steamship service via the Pacific in the early 1850s. With the Royal Mail Line heading the project, a new company called the Australasian Pacific Mail Steam Packet Company was formed in order to start a steam traffic service between Europe and Australia via Panama and Tahiti. The project slowed down in early 1854 due to the Crimean War, which postponed the Government’s interest in such mail contracts. See Bushell, 90–93.</p>

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a968" id="b968">968</a> Details about the start of this service vary. For example, Robinson states that the P&amp;O lost the contract as they were unwilling to stop at Freemantle and Adelaide, but the timetables published by Kirk show that the European &amp; Australian Line steamers did not stop there either. Kirk also notes that the latter company was not subjected to financial penalties e.g. if the Marseilles steamer was late, although the refusal to submit to the system of penalties was mentioned by Robinson and Cable as the most important reason why the P&amp;O could not accept the details of the contract as desired by the government.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a991" id="b991">991</a> From 1866, there was also a contract mail route across the Pacific from Sydney via Wellington, New Zealand, to Panama, across the Isthmus by railway and from Colon by steamer to Southampton. The leg between Australia and Panama was taken care of by the Panama, New Zealand and Australian Royal Mail Company and the leg between Colon and Southampton by existing Royal Mail Line services. This eastbound route enabled 2.5 to three consecutive information circles between Sydney and England per year. The length of the sea voyage sometimes caused the classic situation, where the mails arrived soon after the next ship to Australia had departed. The line existed for only three years.

<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a996" id="b996">996</a> See Rabson, 123. In fact, the Messagerie ships did not sail directly from Shanghai to Suez but there was a change in Hong Kong, and as noted in the text above, P&amp;O changed its departure dates from Shanghai in late 1865 to match the French departures (and the French again changed their departures and the P&amp;O followed). Nevertheless, the P&amp;O cargoes and mails were carried by three different ships to Suez with changes in Hong Kong and Galle. The company preferred to serve the Calcutta merchants by direct sailings to Suez with no changes <em>en route</em>. See the sailing lists published by Kirk (1989), e.g. 91, 187.</p>
<p class="note3"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a997" id="b997">997</a> At least the following mail-carrying vessels were lost in the P&amp;O service east of Suez between 1843 and 1875: the <em>Pacha</em> with 16 lives in 1851, the <em>Douro</em> in 1853, the <em>Erin</em> in 1857, the <em>Alma</em> in 1859, the <em>Canton</em> also in 1859, the <em>Malabar</em> in 1860, the <em>Colombo</em> in 1862, the <em>Corea</em> with 103 lives in 1864, the <em>Niphon</em> with 13 lives in 1868, the <em>Benares</em> also in 1868, the <em>Carnatic</em> with 26 lives in 1869, and the <em>Rangoon</em> in 1871.

<p class="note4"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a1010" id="b1010">1010</a> For example, the Ocean Steam Ship Company of Alfred Holt competed seriously for the mail contracts on the China route in 1867 and 1879, but lost. Holt’s public arguments about the injurious effects of the subsidies on freight and passage rates may be somewhat exaggerated, in view of the quickly changing business environment and its effects as a whole. And even if he strongly criticised the contract system, Holt continuously repeated attempts to secure one for his own company. See Hyde (1956), 40–42. – This happened simultaneously with William Inman’s efforts to capture the mail contract from the Cunard Line in the North Atlantic. Lamport &amp; Holt, the well-known shipping company in which Alfred Holt’s brother George was a main partner, also held a mail contract between Liverpool and South America in 1868–1876.

<p class="note4"><a href="ch008.xhtml#a1017" id="b1017">1017</a> See Cattell, 11. – From 1852, the General Screw service was lengthened by a leg via Mauritius to India.
