<h2>I Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">Earlier studies have shown that the speed of information transmission increased markedly in all parts of the world during the 19th century. Before that period, the development in duration and frequency of sailings had been very much slower.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b1" id="a1">1</a></sup> The fast progress was primarily based on the change from sailing ships and horse-driven coaches to steamers and railways. The telegraph, introduced by the mid-19th century and taken into intercontinental use twenty years later, finally revolutionized the speed of information transmission over long distances. This development has generally been described as a chain of technical improvements. In the real world, things were of course more complicated.</p>
<p class="indent">The title of this study, <em>Across the Oceans – Development of Overseas Business Information Transmission 1815–1875</em>, has been chosen to indicate that shipping and overseas information transmission were unquestionably linked in the 19th century, before the time of aircraft or electric communications. Maritime history is usually seen as the history of shipping, while the development of the speed of information transmission is often included in the history of communications. In particular, Yrjö Kaukiainen, Ian K. Steele and Allan R. Pred have carried out important research by combining these aspects.</p>
<p class="indent">The starting point for this particular study was Yrjö Kaukiainen’s article, in which he showed that the general duration of information transmission had continuously decreased several decades before the breakthrough of the electric telegraph. Kaukiainen based his arguments on maritime intelligence published by <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, calculating how many days it took for the information on ship arrivals in different ports around the world to reach London and be published.</p>
<p class="indent">Interestingly, the shortest time lag e.g. between Barbados and London was 38 days in 1820, but only 20 days in 1860. Similarly, the time lag decreased on the route between Buenos Aires and London from 72 to 40 days; between Valparaiso and London from 109 to 49 days; and between New York and London from 23 to ten days during the same period. The most remarkable changes were seen on the East India route, where the time lag between Bombay and London decreased from 121 to 25 days; and between Calcutta and London, where it decreased from 128 to 35 days between 1820 and 1860.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b2" id="a2">2</a></sup> All this happened before the long distance telegraph was brought into use. The Atlantic cable was laid successfully in 1866, and a direct connection from London to India was opened in 1870. A direct telegraph line to Buenos Aires was available in 1875.</p>
<p class="indent">A great part of the development can naturally be explained by the overall change from sail to steam and the opening of railways over the isthmuses of Suez and Panama. But it is also evident that such changes took time. The networks <em>–</em> shipping routes and regular sailings, railways, canals, and telegraph lines <em>–</em> had to be established, financed and built, as well as coordinated to serve the mail system. Everything could not be done immediately when a new innovation was made. Sometimes a new innovation had to be technologically improved for years before becoming commercially successful, as with the different steam engine solutions for ocean transport.</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier research has already shown that the shift from sailing ships to steamers in bulk transport was mainly based on reducing fuel costs, extending from short trade voyages to longer distances over several decades, instead of just being one technological event.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b3" id="a3">3</a></sup> Also the cost development of shipping during the shift period, particularly the freight rates as well as capital, fuel and labour costs, have been thoroughly examined by maritime historians.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b4" id="a4">4</a></sup> However, most of these studies cover primarily cargo shipping. Mail and passenger services were a rather different business, where speed and regularity were highly valued and the (bulk) freight rates only played a minor role.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b5" id="a5">5</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">New technology was always more expensive to build and use than the old, and included more risks. Financing depended on the expected benefits of the business. To find entrepreneurs or investors for such experiments, there had to be a clear demand for the service. Distant places far from the world’s business centres, such as California or Australia, had to wait for a gold rush to become interesting enough for regular communications services.</p>
<p class="indent">To date, no attention has been paid in discussion on the speed of information transmission to the somewhat varying needs of the heavy users of long distance mail services, especially newspapers and business enterprises. For newspapers, it was extremely important to receive urgent news as quickly as possible, and special arrangements were frequently made to beat the competitors. While fast one-way information transmission was clearly also important from the merchants’ point of view, they needed a system which would work efficiently in both directions. This is the reason why the name of this study includes the term ‘business information transmission’ instead of just ‘information transmission’ or ‘market information transmission’. Although the business enterprises certainly took all the advantage they could of, for example, the telegraph, there was always the need of physical mail transmission as well. This study is about the business information transmission: how new systems were introduced and developed during the period, and how the merchant houses and their trade partners used the growing network of world communications for their different needs.</p>

<p class="indent1">In addition to newspapers and business enterprises, there was also a third major group of interests, i.e. the governmental and military needs for rapid information transmission. As administrative letters could also be carried by naval ships, it has not been possible to include them in this study, except in the cases where the naval vessels also carried ordinary mail, e.g. in the Mediterranean as part of the East India mail route in 1830<em>–</em>1857, or when they were replacing the Admiralty-governed Falmouth packets for one reason or another. Private letters were carried in the same way as the commercial ones, and they are implicitly included in this research without further remarks.</p>
<p class="indent">As this is a study of the logistical development of mail transmission, it will not discuss the networks of the specific merchant houses or the contents of the letters carried. These will be described only by way of example in a few cases.</p>
<p class="indent">In the business world, information flows often consisted of multiple transactions. Although fast one-way information could be crucial in the trade – for example the news of changes in the market situation – it was at least equally important that there was a possibility to react rapidly. Overseas business consisted of numerous letters sent back and forth across the oceans. It was not only important to know the market situation and the prices before making an order, it also had to be known when and by which vessel the freight would be shipped, a bill of lading should be sent to confirm the shipping and a bill of exchange should be sent for the payment.</p>
<p class="indent">Regular correspondence with different companies and agents was often necessary throughout the year. The role of agents has been recently covered by e.g. Jari Ojala, according to whom the constant flow of information was needed not only for the business itself or for vital market information, but also as an important way to achieve trust between the parties undertaking transactions.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b6" id="a6">6</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Improvements in the speed of communications were crucial for many commercial, financial and shipping business activities. Speedier information made capital move faster, directly affecting world trade. Or, as it was seen in Victorian England: ’Increased postal communications… implies increased relations with that country, increased commerce, increased investment of English capital, increased settlement of energetic middle-class Englishmen; and from all these sources, the wealth and prosperity of England… are greatly increased.’<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b7" id="a7">7</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">To what extent economic growth was based on improving communications is difficult to show. There was clearly a connection between them and it seems that the growth in exports correlated positively with the need to create and improve systems for long distance mail transmission.</p>
<p class="indent">In Britain and the United States, the value of merchandise exports grew tenfold between 1820 and 1870, and many other countries followed closely. As Britain in the early 19th century was so much ahead of any other country in economic performance due to the early industrial revolution, its real figures show an even more impressive increase during the period in question. In 1870, the value of British merchandise exports equalled the corresponding figures of the United States, France and Germany combined, even though colonies such as India were not included.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b8" id="a8">8</a></sup></p>

<p class="noindent">In 1820, employment between major economic sectors in Britain differed markedly from any other country. While agriculture, forestry and fisheries employed 37.6% and mining, manufacturing, construction and utilities 32.9%, services already employed 29.5%.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b9" id="a9">9</a></sup> The service sector included financing activities and shipping, both of which were strongly dependent on fast information transmission. 19th century Britain was the world’s main source of foreign capital, investing mainly in Europe and Latin America until 1830, but thereafter increasingly in canal and railway construction in the United States and India.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b10" id="a10">10</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In 1870, less than a quarter (22.6%) of British employment came from agricultural activities, more than 42% came from industry and 35% from the service sector. At the same time, agriculture still accounted for almost half of employment in France and Germany, and for as much as 70% of employment in the United States, where business activities were concentrated in the large cities of the north eastern coast.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b11" id="a11">11</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">In the light of these figures, it is no wonder that the development of faster business information transmission was especially in British interests. The economic structure of other comparable countries did not require it to the same extent. And in terms of potential, the British had coal, iron and the technological knowledge to develop steamship services; a manufacturing industry that created new capital to the market; and tolerable labour costs on board the ships.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b12" id="a12">12</a></sup> Additionally, there was the long tradition of overseas mail services by the British Post Office sailing packets, starting on the route between Falmouth and Lisbon in 1689.</p>
<p class="h3"><strong>The aim of this study, methods, structure and sources in brief</strong></p>
<p class="noindent">This study aims to find out how efficiently the information transmission systems used on the world’s most important mail routes served business during the period 1815–1875. Several concrete cases have also been examined to see how efficiently these services were used in practice.</p>
<p class="indent">We can of course not judge the effectiveness of the 19th century mail systems by any modern criteria. What could be extremely slow in our view, might have been acceptable and even good performance in those circumstances. Thus the development of mail services can only be measured by comparable criteria such as speed, frequency, regularity and reliability. Of these criteria, reliability is the most intangible. It is viewed here from the perspective of information transmission, observing the regularity of sailings as well as the safety of shipping measured by the number of wrecks, both of which varied greatly between the different companies.</p>
<p class="indent">As the study covers a period of six decades, as well as several of the world’s most important trade routes and different mail-carrying systems operated by merchant ships, sailing packets and several nations’ mail steamship services, a specific method has been developed to measure the duration of business information transmission in a systematic and commensurable way.</p>
<p class="indent">The method of calculating consecutive information circles enabled by different means of communications gives a clear picture of the best options available for business information transmission during the year. The development of communications can easily be seen from the comparative figures of different time periods. To complete the picture, the business correspondence of several merchant houses has been used for postal historical research to illustrate how the system worked in practice.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b13" id="a13">13</a></sup> Much emphasis has also been put on the research of the historical context, which is essential for understanding why and how things changed.</p>
<p class="indent">As world trade was so much in British hands during the time period in question, and the most important long distance mail routes were mainly those connecting Britain and its (former) colonies or other important trade partners, the approach of this study is unavoidably British in orientation. Yet the overseas mail services of American, French and German steamship companies have been included where the sailing data has been available. It should be noticed that these services started much later than the British and many of them were active only for a short period.</p>
<p class="indent">Before 1840, the British Post Office sailing packets carried mails from England to North America, the West Indies and South America, while the route to India was covered by the British East India Company until the end of its monopoly. In the 1820s and 1830s, most of the North Atlantic mails were carried by the commercial American sailing packets. At the end of the 1830s, the British Post Office made three important mail contracts: one for the route from England to Halifax (Nova Scotia) and Boston with the Cunard Line, starting in 1840, another for the service to the West Indies with the Royal Mail Line, starting in 1841, and a third for the service via the Mediterranean and Suez to India with the P&amp;O, starting gradually in 1840. The mail steamship service to South America by the Royal Mail Line started in 1851, and the P&amp;O also extended their Asian network markedly during the years thereafter.</p>
<p class="indent">American competition on the North Atlantic route was extremely hard in the 1850s but declined sharply after 1857, when the U.S. Congress made a decision to terminate the government subsidies for mail steamship companies. After the Civil War, the government’s interest was mainly in developing internal structures such as canals and railways, and foreign trade did not expand to the same extent.</p>
<p class="indent">Excluding the short experiment on providing government subsidies for a French steamship company in 1847, the French did not organize corresponding mail services on long-distance routes before the 1860s. The German steamship companies Hamburg-Amerika Linie and Norddeutscher Lloyd were established in the 1850s but they gained greater importance only later, when the emigration to North America expanded after the Civil War and the frequency of the sailings increased. For these obvious reasons, the space given to the different mail services and companies in this study depends very much on the length of the time the services existed. The electric telegraph entered the picture rather late from this study’s point of view. The importance of telegrams as business communication tools increased notably later, towards the end of the century, when the prices of the service were reduced to a more reasonable level.</p>
<p class="indent">John J. McCusker has compressed the overall development of business press and the ‘Information Revolution’ during the last five centuries in three words: ‘better, faster and cheaper’.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b14" id="a14">14</a></sup> However, the question of information costs could not easily be covered here. There would not only be the angle of the users of different mail services, but also the viewpoints of mail-carrying shipping companies as well as the governments that paid for the services by awarding mail contracts.</p>
<p class="indent">During the period in question – the time before the Universal Postal Union, or the UPU – there was no uniformed system for overseas mail, but only bilateral postal treaties between the countries. The contents of the treaties varied and they were renegotiated several times over the decades in question. The postage rates varied in each case depending on the ship by which the letter was carried (private or official mail-carrier), on the route and the mail contract under which the letter was carried, as well as the length of the inland voyage at both ends of the journey. Even during the same period there were alternatives for sending mail with different costs.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b15" id="a15">15</a></sup> And furthermore, in the first half of the 19th century it was mostly the recipient who paid for the letters when receiving them, not the sender who chose the means of communication.</p>
<p class="indent">From the operator’s – the mail-carrying shipping company’s – perspective, faster communication increased costs. The expenses of building and operating steamships were manifold compared with sailing vessels. And newer and faster steamers were needed all the time to keep up with the competitors. Also the laying of submarine cables was conducted by huge expenses. Many companies failed, and only a few succeeded. For the governments, the mail contracts were usually a fiscal burden and a subject for continuous political debate.</p>
<p class="indent">Due to the wide spread of the subject, the costs of information transmission are touched here only as examples of different aspects. The intention of this study is mainly to try to find an answer to the question: was there a ‘revolution’ in the way of organizing the global business information transmission in the 19th century. And if there was, when was it and what happened really?</p>
<p class="indent">Earlier research on business communications will be discussed in Chapter II and the use of different methods and sources in measuring the speed of information transmission in Chapter III. A short introduction to the overseas mail systems and the development of the speed of communications before 1815 will be presented in Chapter IV.</p>
<p class="indent">The study covers the time period from the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 to the formation of the UPU in 1875, which finally uniformed the regulations of the world’s mail systems and rates. Two important shift periods are thus included: the transition from sail to steam in overseas mail transport, and the introduction of the intercontinental telegraph.</p>
<p class="indent">There would have been at least two different ways of organizing the main contents (chapters V<em>–</em>VII) of the study. The first would have been a chronological approach:</p>
<ul class="bul">
<li>Sail vs. sail</li>
<li>Sail vs. steam</li>
<li>Steam vs. steam</li>
<li>Steam vs. telegraph</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">These periods of different means of overseas communication, including the two shift periods, would then have been examined geographically. To make it easier for the reader to follow the long-term development of communications on each main trade route, another approach has been chosen. The development of the speed of communications is examined route by route with the North Atlantic, the West Indies, South America, Panama, East India, China, Australia and South Africa being the main areas of interest. This appeared to be the right solution, as the improvements in the mail systems did not take place simultaneously but each route had its own character, depending on historical background, economic importance, geographic location, technological challenges and other matters.</p>
<p class="indent">Of all the sources available, the sailing data of the mail-carrying ships give an answer to most of the general questions about how overseas business information transmission was organized during the different time periods. Therefore the sailing lists, to date rather unknown in academic research, have been chosen to form the basis of this study. Postal historians have worked for several decades collecting the sailing data of mail-carrying ships from different newspapers and organizing all the information into comprehensive lists. The objective has been to serve philatelists, who need this kind of accurate information to verify the authenticity of letters in their collection.</p>
<p class="indent">The published lists cover the sailings of the Falmouth packets to Halifax and New York between 1815 and 1840, and to South America until the end of 1850. They cover all the North Atlantic mail sailings of more than 30 shipping companies between 1838 and 1875; the mail steamship services to the West Indies by the Royal Mail Line from 1841 onwards; all British mail steamship contract services to South America from 1851; and the French services from the early 1860s. They also cover the P&amp;O&apos;s various routes from the 1840s, the British Admiralty&apos;s services on the Mediterranean between 1830 and 1857; and American coastal steamship services of the early 1850s, to name but a few of the most important ones.</p>
<p class="indent">To get an impression of the number of sailings listed, we can look at Walter Hubbard&apos;s and Richard Winter&apos;s extremely useful <em>North Atlantic Mail Sailings 1840–1875,</em> which alone includes some 14,000 Atlantic crossings with all relevant data from the ship’s departure port and sailing date to the details of the arrival. The ports of call are also included, and delays are often explained in the notes.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b16" id="a16">16</a></sup> The lists do not repeat the schedules advertised before the trip by agents or shipping companies, but they are based on factual sailing data published by newspapers, thus describing what happened in reality. During the age of sail and steam, this was often a very different story.</p>
<p class="indent">Although much has been done, there are also gaps in the published sailing data. The writer of this study has not been able to find sailing lists of the Falmouth packet sailings to the West Indies or Central America. The departure and arrival dates of the American sailing packets have not been published either. The historian Robert Albion, who calculated the duration of each of the more than 4,000 westbound voyages of these packets for his book <em>Square-Riggers on Schedule,</em><sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b17" id="a17">17</a></sup> never published the actual sailing dates. And furthermore, sailing data has not been systematically collected from journeys made by merchant vessels, which also carried mail.</p>
<p class="indent">If the sailing data needed for this study has not been found from previously published postal historical sources, it has been collected from <em>Lloyd’s List</em>, with a few years’ double-checking from the <em>Liverpool Customs Bills of Entry</em>. In addition to the new details about the Falmouth and American sailing packet services, this work includes nearly 600 records from the merchant ship traffic between Britain and British Guiana in 1840, as well as all port calls of the whole round trip of nearly 400 British merchant vessels between around 20 ports on the way from England to India, China, Southeast Asia and Australia in January 1832 – June 1834. The number of recorded dates in the last mentioned period exceeds 2,000.</p>
<p class="indent">To find out the difference between the duration of the mail transport itself and the duration of the whole process between writing a letter and receiving it, postal historical studies of merchant correspondence have also been included in this research. For this, the overseas correspondence of several Liverpool and London merchant houses, as well as the honourable East India Company have been studied and compared with respective sailing data.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#b18" id="a18">18</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The material includes correspondence of the following merchant houses:</p>
<ul class="bul">
<li>Sandbach, Tinne &amp; Co., 1825<em>–</em>1870 (West Indies<em>–</em>Liverpool)</li>
<li>Thomas and William Earle &amp; Co., 1836<em>–</em>1870 (West Indies<em>–</em>Liverpool)</li>
